## Introduction

Mintlify makes it possible for anyone to create beautiful documentation websites, and this quickstart guide will get you up and running with Mintlify in a matter of minutes.

## Before you begin

This guide assumes some experience with [git](#) and [npm](#). If you're not familiar with these concepts, get up to speed by checking out the [Prerequisites](#) page.

## Setting up a project

1. [Sign up for a Mintlify account](#).
1. Select **Sign in with GitHub**.
1. Select **Create a documentation repo**.

   A repo will be created at the following location:

   ```
   https://www.github.com/<owner>/docs
   ```

   This repo is already configured to use the [Mintlify for GitHub](#) app, so any changes to the content or configuration will automatically be published to the documentation website.

## Making changes

1. Clone the documentation repo:

   ```bash
   git clone [url]
   ```

1. Navigate into the repo:

   ```bash
   cd [directory]
   ```

1. Edit one of the example pages, such as `introduction.mdx`:

   ```md
   ---
   title: Introduction
   description: "Welcome to the home of your new documentation"
   ---
   ```

1. Commit and push the changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit --message "Some amazing change"
   git push
   ```

   The changes should appear on the documentation website within a few minutes.

## Previewing changes

1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](#):

   ```bash
   npm install mintlify  --global
   ```

2. Run the following command from within the documentation repo:

   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```

   A local server will start running at http://localhost:3000.

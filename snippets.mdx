import { Install } from "/snippets/install.mdx";

## Introduction

Snippets are reusable fragments of content that can be embedded in [pages](#). You can use snippets to ensure that documentation is consistent, up to date, and easy to maintain.

## Supported content

Any type of content that can exist within a page can exist within a snippet, including:

- [Markdown](#)
- [MDX](#)
- [UI components](#)

## Creating snippets

1. Add a `snippets` directory to the root of the documentation project:

   ```bash
   mkdir snippets
   ```

2. In the `snippets` directory, create a file with a `.mdx` extension:

   ```bash
   touch snippets/greeting.mdx
   ```

3. Add some content to the snippet file:

   ```mdx snippets/greeting.mdx
   Hello, world!
   ```

## Using snippets

1. Import the snippet into a page:

   ```md
   ---
   title: Quickstart
   subtitle: How to get started with the thing.
   ---

   import Greeting from "/snippets/greeting.mdx";
   ```

2. Use a self-closing JSX tag to embed the snippet:

   ```mdx
   <Greeting />
   ```

## Creating dynamic snippets

You can define parameters for snippets. These parameters make the snippet dynamic by allowing content to be passed into them where they're used — not just where they're defined. This enables the reuse of content that is similar but not exactly the same.

To create a dynamic snippet:

1. In the snippet file, use curly braces to define one or more [variables](#):

   ```mdx
   Hello, {name}! How are you?
   ```

2. When using the snippet, define the values of the variable(s) as JSX props:

   ```mdx
   <Greeting name="John" />
   <Greeting name="Paul" />
   <Greeting name="George" />
   <Greeting name="Ringo" />
   ```

## Example snippets

This section contains some examples of how you might like to use snippets. For more practical examples of how to use snippets, [browse our snippet recipes](#).

### Deprecation warnings

As a platform matures, there's often a need to deprecate features. This snippet provides a consistent way to inform users about deprecated features.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Usage">

```md
import DeprecationWarning from "/snippets/deprecation-warning.mdx";

<DeprecationWarning />
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Snippet">

```mdx snippets/deprecation-warning.mdx
<Warning>

This API has been deprecated. To learn more, see [Deprecation policy](deprecation-policy).

</Warning>
```

### Tutorial steps

When documentation has a lot of step-by-step guides, certain steps may appear across multiple guides. For example, a step that involves setting up a development environment.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Usage">

```mdx hello-world.mdx
import DevEnvironmentStep from "/snippets/dev-environment-step.mdx";

<Steps>

<DevEnvironmentStep />

{/* Step 2 */}

{/* Step 3 */}

</Steps>
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Snippet">

````mdx snippets/dev-environment-step.mdx
<Step title="Set up a development environment">

1. Clone the following repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd example-project
   ```

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Best practices

- Don't create snippets before they're required.
- Don't organize snippets before it's necessary.
- Review snippets from time to time -- avoid staleness!
- Be careful when updating snippets -- side-effects!
- Be careful about reusing content that seems similar.

## Gotchas

- You can't create pages within the `snippets` directory.
- You can't use variables in code blocks.

## Troubleshooting

- https://mdxjs.com/docs/troubleshooting-mdx/#problems-writing-mdx
- Reserved keywords in variables.
